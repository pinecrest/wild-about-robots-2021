Code and examples for the Wild About Robots 2021 presentation at the Innovation Institute

## Using Ultrasonic Sensors

The ultrasonic sensor is an inexpensive, ubiquitous way to measure distance using high-frequency sound waves. The code examples below show you a simple way to measure distance in centimeters with MakeCode and Python.

### Extension Opportunities

- Measure distance in other units of measure, like feet, meters, or cubits.
- Try measuring distances to a variety of surfaces, e.g. hard vs. soft, textured vs. smooth, etc.
- Plot the distance using the plotter in Mu editor

## Using Servos

Servos are small geared motors that can move to a specific angle. They're commonly used in R/C cars, robots, and toys because they're cheap and relatively precise.

### Extension Opportunities

- Make the servo move when you press one of the micro:bit's buttons
- Use the ultrasonic sensor to move the servo
- Create a paper fish and use the servo to make it "swim"
