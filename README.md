## Using Ultrasonic Sensors

The ultrasonic sensor is an inexpensive, ubiquitous way to measure distance using high-frequency sound waves. The code examples below show you a simple way to measure distance in centimeters with MakeCode and Python.

- [Basic Ultrasonic MakeCode](https://makecode.microbit.org/_CT9Fmxg5eHTo)
- [Basic Ultrasonic Python](python-examples/ultrasonic_sensor/basic_ultrasonic_sensor.py)

### Extension Opportunities

- Measure distance in other units of measure, like feet, meters, or cubits.
- Try measuring distances to a variety of surfaces, e.g. hard vs. soft, textured vs. smooth, etc.
- Plot the distance using the plotter in Mu editor

## Using Servos

Servos are small geared motors that can move to a specific angle. They're commonly used in R/C cars, robots, and toys because they're cheap and relatively precise.

- [Servo Loop Makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/13643-67225-58833-69554)
- [Servo Loop Python](python-examples/servos/other_examples/servo_test_loop.py)

### Extension Opportunities

- Make the servo move when you press one of the micro:bit's buttons ([Python example](python-examples/servos/other_examples/servo_button_ab_push.py))
- Use the ultrasonic sensor to move the servo ([Python Example](python-examples/servos/other_examples/servo_ultrasonic_smoothed.py))
- Create a paper fish and use the servo to make it "swim"

## The Linear Actuator

The 3D-printed parts in your bag can be used to assemble a linear actuator showing rotational movement translated into linear movement. If you want to print your own, we have uploaded the [STL files](3d_files) for you and made the link to the [Fusion 360 design](https://a360.co/3edgf95) public for you.
